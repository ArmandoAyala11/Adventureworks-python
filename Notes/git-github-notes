Git

Clone a project
git clone git@github.com:ArmandoAyala11/Adventureworks-python.git

Create a branch
git checkout -b "Initial-branch"

View status
git status

Add files/folders to commit
git add --all
git add file-name

Show existing branches
git branch

Create commit
git commit -m "Hello world"

Push created branch to origin on Github
git push origin Initial-branch

Move to main branch (move from one to another branch)
git checkout main
git switch branch-name

Get the last changes on local repository from remote repository
git fetch origin

After fetching the origin we can review the remote branches
git branch -r

View the logs on local workspace
git log --oneline

Jump into the remote branch to view changes made
git checkout origin/main

Get back to our local workspace which is not up to date
Also can switch other branches to see the changes
git switch main

This command will overwrite our local workspace with the latest changes on our remote branch â€” double check the current branch before executing the pull command
git pull origin main
